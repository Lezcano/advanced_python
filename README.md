# Advanced Python Course
This is a repository containing notes and short scripts / sessions used in the course given in the Spring 2019 at Keble college (University of Oxford).

The course will follow some chapters of the book [Fluent Python][1], seasoned with examples and comparisons between python and other languages (mostly C / C++).

The classes will be in the **MCR at the HB Allen Centre** (25 Banbury Rd.) on **Tuesdays at 7pm**.

There is a mailing list for the course where the announces will be made. Contact Mario Lezcano if you want to be added.

In the [src folder](src/) you can find snippets used for illustration in the different classes, and a "session" with the commands executed during the class.

In the [classes.md](classes.md) file, you can find a summary of the contents touched on each class.

This repository does not intend to be a substitute for the classes, but more like a complement to those that attended the course. If you cannot make it to one class but you would like to know what we covered in that class, please contact me.
