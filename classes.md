- The Zen of Python
    - `import this`
- Duck Typing
    - If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck
- A word on efficiency
    - Premature optimisation is the root of all evil
    - Premature pesimisation vs. premature optimisation
    - If you do care:
        - Vectorise and measure
        - Rule of thumb: Shorter (in number of calls) is better
- A word on inheritance
    - Think about it as decorating the class
