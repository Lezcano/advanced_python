# Short notes on the classes

## Class 0: Generalities
- The Zen of Python
    - `import this`
- Duck Typing
    - If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck
- A word on efficiency
    - Premature optimisation is the root of all evil
    - Premature pesimisation vs. premature optimisation
    - If you do care:
        - Vectorise and measure
        - Rule of thumb: Shorter (in number of calls) is better
- A word on inheritance
    - Think about it as decorating the class

## Class 1: Flat containers
- [p.20 UML diagram]
- List comprehensions
    - Syntax
    - Their values are local: `x = 3; [x for x in range(5)]`
    - Prefer list comprehension over `map` / `filter`
    - Cartesian product.
- Generator expressions [More in Chapter 14]
    - Syntax
    - Example in for loop and min function
- Tuples
    - Syntax
    - As immutable lists
    - As records: Less space than an object
    - Unpacking (as with any sequence)
        - Swap two variables
        - Star operator for calling functions with tuple (Ex.)
        - Return multiple values (Ex.)
        - Nesting works fine (Ex.)
    - `Card = collections.namedtuple('Card', ['rank', 'suit'])`
- Slicing
    - Syntax (Ex palindrome: a == a[::-1])
    - Slice object. `seq.__getitem___(slice(start, stop, step))`
    - Multidimensional slicing. [`my_seq.py`]
    - Ellipsis (Numpy)
    - Assigning to slice: rhs has to be an iterable
- Sequences
    - Operator + and *
        - Lists of lists and operator *. [`operator_mul.py`, `fix_operator_mul.py`]
        - Mention empty list of lists
    - Operator += and *=: Mutable vs immutable [`mutable_vs_immutable.py`]
        - Puzzle [`puzzle.py`]: Putting mutable objects in immutable objects is not good
    - Sorted sequences
        - `.sort()` vs `sorted`
        - `bisect`, `insort`
- A word on numpy / scipy / torch
- Deques
    - Efficiency and thread-safe
    - Rotate and append left / right
    - Removing from middle is slow
    - Mention heapq module and asyncio.PriorityQueue
